# LeekwarsMyLeeks
Repository for my leekwars scripts

Visit my leeks and refer to me here: https://leekwars.com/godfather/DasDZY

Nita is a script for a leek with more mp and less strength and hitpoints.

For those wondering:
- Yes, this is a basic abstraction, hope that helps many users.
- No, you won't find the holy grail here. All movement scripts are still pretty basic.
- Most scripts depend on maximum level 39.
- Most files will appear to have errors. As long as Main is okay, everything is fine. This is a lack in interpreting the includes.

Feel free to create branches and put your updates there. You also may link your branch to your leekwars farmer, so you do not have to create a repository by yourself.

I will selfish use good features ;) and bring them to the master branch. Just like you selfishly took my script to eventually bring your tactics to a good abstration. It is win win and I gave up to code secrets because this is my spare time and I want to get more fun out of this.
